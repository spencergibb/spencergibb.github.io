In February, I had the priviledge of attending [ConFoo](https://confoo.ca/en/2024). It was my first time visiting Montreal Quebec. I had a great time.

I presented two talks, [What's New In Spring](/preso/confoo-2024-whats-new-in-spring) and [API Toolbox with Spring](/preso/confoo-2024-api-toolbox-with-spring). Yann Larrivee and team did a fantastic job organizing and running the event at the [Hotel Bonaventure](https://confoo.ca/en/2024/venue). The venue was great just being a few steps away from hotel room to conference center. The pool is open year round and I took a swim, while it was freezing outsite, the pool was warm.

The food was top notch, the best I've ever had attending conferences over my 25+ year career.

I enjoyed listing to various talks as well, some examples are: [QUIC and HTTP/3: the next step in web performance
](https://confoo.ca/en/2024/session/quic-and-http-3-the-next-step-in-web-performance), [Chopping the monolith
](https://confoo.ca/en/2024/session/chopping-the-monolith), and [GC Algorithms for the Cloud
](https://confoo.ca/en/2024/session/gc-algorithms-for-the-cloud). The speaker dinner was excelent and I got to meet new people and make some connections, even on the plane home I sat next to a ConFoo speaker!

I even got to see a bit of the city. The [Notre-Dame Basilica of Montreal](https://www.basiliquenotredame.ca/en) was truly stunning. I was also able to explore a bit of the underground city to find some good places to eat. I also found one of my alltime things while roaming underground, Fairlife Banana! I may or may not have [imported](https://tnscanadagrocerystore.com/products/fairlife-core-power-26g-protein-milk-shakes-banana-made-with-canadian-milk-pack-of-12-shipped-from-canada_b0cg512gmk_) some.

I hope I can return to ConFoo and Montreal in the future.
